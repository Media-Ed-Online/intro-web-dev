**README files** are text files that simply contain information about their directory. They explain why the project is useful, what kinds of files it may have, its history, or any other relevant points worth elaborating.

<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> uses **Markdown** extensively within its ecosystem for documentation; README files and Issues postings are written using Markdown.


## Files and Directories
If a `README.md` file is put in a repository's root directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors - meaning it's the first thing they'll see, with no extra clicking.

<div class="code-heading">
  <span>Directory Tree</span>
</div>
<pre id="bash">
.
└── <i class="far fa-folder-open"></i> assignment-01/
    └── <i class="fab fa-markdown"></i> README.md

</pre>

Don't worry if this doesn't quite make sense yet: we can provide an example! Go ahead, <a href="{{ site.git_address }}#readme" target="_blank">check ours out</a>.

## For Our Purposes
**For every assignment you submit, you will also write a short report in a plain-text file.** For most, this report is the `README.md` for that directory, and may discuss a number of things every week:

- Questions regarding your understanding of the Topic's materials.
- Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
- Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
- What problems did you have? How did you solve them?
