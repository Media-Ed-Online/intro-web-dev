The **input element** is used to collect data from users. This is an element that you will likely use often as a web developer. The data collected by this element can be sent as part of a bunch of data in a form element to a server. This element can also be accessed through client-side JavaScript, allowing developers to create ways of getting data they can process on the client-computer.
