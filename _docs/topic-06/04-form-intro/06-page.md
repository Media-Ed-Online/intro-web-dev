<div class="divider-heading"></div>

## Altogether

A form is a combination of action, method, and identification:


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get" id="subscribe-form" class="basic-forms">
    <!-- This is where the related form elements and controls will appear. -->
</form>
```


The `<form>` doesn't look like much now, and will really take shape with the addition of **input elements.**
