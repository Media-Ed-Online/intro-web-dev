Despite how it sounds, Mark<u>down</u> is actually a mark<u>up</u> language! A **markup language** is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Markup languages tend to encourage writers to focus on _content_ and _structure_ before concerning themselves with presentation.

Structure is defined for a processor through the use of tags embedded directly in the text.
