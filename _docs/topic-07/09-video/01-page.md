<div class="divider-heading"></div>

The `<video>` element allows developers to add a video player to webpages. This is a new element to HTML5, and offers three supported video formats: .mp4, .webm, and .ogg.

The **video element** can be used to add a self-hosted video file to your site, and allows for both single-instances and fallback files to be referenced in the element.
