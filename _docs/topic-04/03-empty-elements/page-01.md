<div class="divider-heading"></div>

Now that you know that most elements are made up of an opening-closing pair of tags, it's worth noting that there are a handful of important single-tag instances known as **empty elements**.

An “empty element” only has one tag. Before the closing bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward-slash ( **/** ) character. It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way.


<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<p>This is a paragraph. If I want additional spacing between this and the next paragraph, I can add a LINE BREAK.</p>

<br />

<p>This is another paragraph, further down the page.</p>
```
